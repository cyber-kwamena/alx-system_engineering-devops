Issue Summary:

Duration: 2 hours, from 8:00 PM to 10:00 PM (UTC)

Impact: The website was completely down, with all services inaccessible to users. All users trying to access the website received error messages or timed-out responses.

Root Cause: The root cause of the outage was a hardware failure in one of the servers hosting the website. The failed server was responsible for managing the database, and its failure caused a complete disruption of the website's functionality.

Timeline:

    8:00 PM - The issue was first detected when several monitoring alerts indicated that the website was no longer responding to requests.
    8:10 PM - Engineers investigated the issue and discovered that the database server had failed.
    8:30 PM - A backup server was brought online and configured to serve as the new database server.
    8:45 PM - The team discovered that the backup server was not fully up-to-date, and data was missing from the database.
    9:00 PM - Engineers began restoring the missing data from backups and other sources.
    9:30 PM - The restored data was verified and the website was brought back online.
    10:00 PM - All services were fully operational and the issue was resolved.

Root Cause and Resolution:

The root cause of the outage was a hardware failure in the database server. The failed server was replaced with a backup server, but the backup server was not fully up-to-date, resulting in missing data. The missing data was restored from backups and other sources, and the website was brought back online.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:

To prevent similar outages in the future, the team has implemented several corrective and preventative measures:

    Regular hardware maintenance and replacement to minimize the risk of hardware failures.
    Improvements to the backup and disaster recovery processes to ensure that all data is up-to-date and can be restored quickly in the event of an outage.
    Additional monitoring and alerting to detect hardware failures and other issues early and prevent extended outages.
    Testing of backup and disaster recovery processes to ensure that they are effective and reliable in restoring service quickly in the event of an outage.

Overall, the outage highlighted the importance of regular maintenance and testing of backup and disaster recovery processes to ensure that services can be restored quickly in the event of an outage. The team has taken steps to address these issues and improve the overall reliability and availability of the website.
