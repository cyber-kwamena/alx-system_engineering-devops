# Background Context

### Web infrastructure is already serving web pages via Nginx that was installed in [web stack project](https://github.com/JoeKAboagye/alx-system_engineering-devops/tree/main/0x0C-web_server). While a web server can also serve dynamic content, this task is usually given to an application server. In this project we will add this piece to the infrastructure, plug it to your Nginx and make it serve [Airbnb clone project](https://github.com/JoeKAboagye/AirBnB_clone_v2).
